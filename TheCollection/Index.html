			<h2>My favorite's</h2>
			<h4>
				Hi guys! This a glimpse of the type of music I listen to! First off all is Michael Jackson, who my idol.
				Why do I like him so much? Well he is exceptional and I like that in his performance, he always tries to
				give the best of himself.
				He rehearses things over and over until he reaches perfection.There's much more I can say about him, but
				I mostly like his voice.
				He can reach so many different notes with his voice and is distinguishable from most voices you hear.
				You can pick him out immediately!
